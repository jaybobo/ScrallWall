###Description:

ScrallWall combines geolocation, user-generated content, and open city data and APIs to allow users to share and discover found art, facilitate urban exploration, and empower local communities to control their own beautification. Our app allows users to share their geotagged pictures of street art, browse them on a map, and vote on whether it improves their community. If the community disapproves of an artifact, the City is automatically notified to remove it.
